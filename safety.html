     <h2> Self defence for girls </h2>
     <p>Self-defense empowers girls to protect themselves in dangerous situations by building confidence and awareness. It involves learning techniques to fend off attackers, but also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and avoiding potential threats. Developing self-defense skills not only enhances physical safety but also boosts mental strength and resilience.
